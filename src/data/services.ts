            <h2>The No.1 Solution for Cape Winter Leaks</h2>
            <p>In Cape Town, waterproofing isn't a luxury—it's a necessity. The combination of torrential winter rains and blistering summer heat causes standard sealants to crack and fail. At <strong>The Maintenance Team (TMT)</strong>, we don't just patch leaks; we engineer permanent solutions.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Waterproofing Systems</h3>
            <p>We utilize industrial-grade materials suited for the harsh Western Cape climate, including 4mm Torch-on membranes for flat roofs and specialized cementitious slurries for retaining walls.</p>

            <h3>Why Choose TMT for Waterproofing?</h3>
            <p>Leak detection is an art. Our team uses moisture mapping to identify the root cause of water ingress, ensuring we fix the problem at the source, not just the symptom. Every full waterproofing project comes with a <strong>CERTIFIED 10-YEAR GUARANTEE</strong>.</p>
             <blockquote>
                "Water damage is progressive. A small damp spot today is a structural failure tomorrow. Protect your asset with TMT."
            </blockquote>
            <h3>Areas We cover in Cape Town</h3>
            <p>From the Atlantic Seaboard to the Southern Suburbs, our mobile teams are ready to deploy. We treat every home with the same rigor as an industrial site—clean, efficient, and built to last.</p>

            <p>A faded, moss-covered roof doesn't just look bad—it degrades your property's value. Durbanville's leafy environment often leads to heavy fungal and moss buildup on tiled roofs. <strong>The Maintenance Team</strong> restores your roof to showroom condition.</p>
            
            <h3>Thermal Efficiency</h3>
            <p>Modern roof coatings do more than look good. They reflect UV rays, lowering the internal temperature of your home during Durbanville's hot summers. Ask us about our <strong>Heat-Reflective Cool Roof</strong> options.</p>

            <h3>Why Spray Painting?</h3>
            <p>Airless spraying forces paint into the pores of the tiles, creating a stronger bond and a thicker film build than traditional rolling. The result is a finish that lasts 10+ years without peeling.</p>

            <p>Bloubergstrand offers beautiful views, but the salt-laden air is brutal on buildings. "Spalling" or concrete cancer occurs when steel reinforcing bars rust and expand, cracking the concrete from the inside out. This is a critical structural failure that requires expert intervention.</p>
            
            <h3>Crack Injection & Stitching</h3>
            <p>For non-structural cracks, we utilize epoxy injection systems that weld the masonry back together, preventing water ingress and further movement.</p>

            <h3>Don't Wait on Cracks</h3>
            <p>In Blouberg's corrosive environment, a small crack allows salt air to reach your rebar quickly. Early intervention saves tens of thousands in future heavy construction costs. Call TMT for a specialized structural assessment.</p>

                { question: "Will high-pressure cleaning damage my plants or grass?", answer: "No. We pre-soak surrounding vegetation and use biodegradable cleaning agents. For sensitive landscaped gardens in areas like Constantia, we use barriers to control runoff." },
                { question: "How long does paving sealing last?", answer: "A high-quality sealer typically lasts 2–3 years. We recommend a 'maintenance coat' every 24 months to keep your patio looking pristine." },
                { question: "Do you remove oil stains from driveways?", answer: "We use bio-degradable degreasers with a high success rate. Deeply penetrated oil in porous stone may not be 100% removable but can be significantly lightened." },
                { question: "Why do I need to re-sand my paving?", answer: "Re-sanding is critical to prevent pavers from shifting, wobbling, or sinking over time, acting as the 'glue' that holds them together." }
